# Creating-SQL_database
Creating local database from existing dataframe using sqlite3 in python environment

# why this project:
After doing several courses in SQL via using sql clients such as dbeaver, I wanted to do the whole process in python environment rather then jumping back and forth from python client to sql and vice-verca

# the code:
I used the same data that i scraped from yahoo finance for this project. I created local database file and inserted data from the dataframe made with pandas using sqlite3. Then I played around a bit to have fun. Then I thought why not return the database file as csv as it initially was. I guess not everyone likes changes :P
